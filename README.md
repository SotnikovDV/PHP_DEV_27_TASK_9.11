***SkillFactory Group PHP_DEV_27 Task 9.11 - Persons generation***

## 1. Project description 

Random user data generator: full name, gender, date of birth and profession. With the ability to drop information. The selection of data comes from prepared JSON values using Math.random.

The photo is taken from the random face generation service: https://thispersondoesnotexist.com

Unfortunately, it is not possible to request a specific male or female photo. For this reason, sometimes there is a discrepancy between the sex in the photograph and in personal data.

Developed as a practical task in the course "PHP Developer"
